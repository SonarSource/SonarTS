# SonarTS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SonarSource/SonarTS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SonarSource/SonarTS) [![Quality Gate](https://next.sonarqube.com/sonarqube/api/project_badges/measure?project=sonarts&metric=alert_status)](https://next.sonarqube.com/sonarqube/dashboard?id=sonarts)

TypeScript analysis for SonarQube was migrated to [SonarJS](https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarJS) plugin.
This is a legacy repository used to produce an artifact required for backward compatibility with SonarQube.

If you are interested in the plugin for TSLint, check [v1.9](https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarTS/tree/1.9.0.3766) which was the last release of [`tslint-sonarts` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-sonarts).
