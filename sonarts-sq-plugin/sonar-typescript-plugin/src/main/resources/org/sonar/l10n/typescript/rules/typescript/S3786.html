<p>Template strings allow developers to embed variables or expressions in strings using template literals, instead of string concatenation. This is
done by using expressions like <code>${variable} </code> in a string between two back-ticks (<code>`</code>). However, when used in a regular string
literal (between double or single quotes) the template will not be evaluated and will be used as a literal, which is probably not what was
intended.</p>
