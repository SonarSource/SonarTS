<p>Many of JavaScript's <code>Array</code> methods return an altered version of the array while leaving the source array intact. <code>reverse</code>
and <code>sort</code> do not fall into this category. Instead, they alter the source array <em>in addition to</em> returning the altered version,
which is likely not what was intended.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the return values of these methods are assigned, which could lead maintainers to overlook the fact that the original
value is altered.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var b = a.reverse(); // Noncompliant
var d = c.sort(); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
var b = [...a].reverse();  // de-structure and create a new array, so reverse doesn't impact 'a'
a.reverse();

c.sort(); // this sorts array in place
</pre>
