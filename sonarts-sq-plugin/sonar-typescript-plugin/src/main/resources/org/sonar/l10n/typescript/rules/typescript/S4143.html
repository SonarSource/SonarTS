<p>It is highly suspicious when a value is saved for a key or index and then unconditionally </p>
<p>overwritten. Such replacements are likely in error.</p>
<p>This rule will check if array index, key in the Map, element in the Set or object property is overwritten without being </p>
<p>used in consecutive sequence of assignment statements inside single block.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
 fruits[1] = "banana";
 fruits[1] = "apple";  // Noncompliant - value on index 1 is overwritten

 myMap.set("key", 1);
 myMap.set("key", 2); // Noncompliant - value for key "key" is replaced

 mySet.add(1);
 mySet.add(2); // Noncompliant - element is already in the set
</pre>
