<p>When a collection is empty it makes no sense to access or iterate it. Doing so anyway is surely an error; either population was accidentally
omitted or the developer doesn't understand the situation.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
let strings = [];

if (strings.includes("foo")) {}  // Noncompliant

for (str of strings) {}  // Noncompliant

strings.forEach(str =&gt; doSomething(str)); // Noncompliant

</pre>
