<p>Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in (possibly nested) objects and arrays. However, it is possible
to create an empty pattern that has no effect. When empty curly braces or brackets are used to the right of a property name most of the time the
intent was to use a default value instead.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when empty destructuring pattern is used.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var {a: {}, b} = myObj; // Noncompliant
function foo({first: [], second}) { // Noncompliant
  // ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
var {a = {}, b} = myObj;
function foo({first = [], second}) {
  // ...
}
</pre>
