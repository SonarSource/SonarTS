<p>The <code>eval</code> function is a way to run arbitrary code at run-time. Generally it is considered to be very dangerous because it allows
execution of arbitrary code. Its use is thus discouraged. If you have carefully verified that there is no other option than to use this construct, pay
special attention not to pass any user-provided data into it without properly validating it beforehand.</p>
