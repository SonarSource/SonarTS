<p>If a function does not return anything, it makes no sense to use its output. Specifically, passing it to another function, or assigning its
"result" to a variable is probably a bug because such functions return <code>undefined</code>, which is probably not what was intended.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
function foo() {
}

a = foo();
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
function foo() {
}

foo();
</pre>
