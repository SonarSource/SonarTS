## The Contrast of major and minor relationship

<img class="preview-img bad" align="right" alt="bad example" src="https://os.alipayobjects.com/rmsportal/TOupLSPNQkBTmYw.png">

In order to help user make a quick operation (something like the form，modal), a more important operation or a operation with higher frequency would be emphasized.

> Notes: ways of emphasizing are not just to intensify the key item. It could also weaken the other items.

When there’s something needs users to make decision prudently, the system should remain neutral. It shouldn’t make the decision for users or lead them to make judgement.

## Contrast of whole and part

<img class="preview-img" align="right" alt="Example of whole and part 2" src="https://os.alipayobjects.com/rmsportal/bafqoUWFgXjsuSG.png">

Taking advantage of changing the typesetting, the typeface and the size, we highlight the different levels and differentiate the ensemble and the part, which would make the page be more flexible and rhythmic.

## Contrast of the state relation

<img class="preview-img" align="right" alt="Example of dynamic contrast" description="When the mouse doesn’t be moved, this item and other items would show different visual effects obviously, which would influence the user’s operation." src="https://os.alipayobjects.com/rmsportal/DCAtXAEaFnAXEmG.png">

Taking advantage of changing colors and adding assistant shapes, we realize the comparison of state relation, which could help users differentiate various information better

The forms we usually see include 『static contrast』 and 『dynamic contrast』.
