## Where can I get it?

Download the installer for your OS:

 - [macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin)
 - [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)
 - [Windows machine-wide install](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32?format=msi)

You can install this alongside your existing GitHub Desktop for Mac or GitHub
Desktop for Windows application.

**NOTE**: there is no current migration path to import your existing
repositories into the new application - you can drag-and-drop your repositories
from disk onto the application to get started.
