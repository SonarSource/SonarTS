# Roadmap

Currently the team are focused on the 1.0 release, which should represent the
set of features which enable users to replace the previous Classic Mac and
Windows apps with this new Electron app.

Along with that, we'll be working on feedback and issues reported from the
public beta. But feel free to open issues and start discussions on things
you'd like to see in the app.

Over time, we'll be using [Milestones](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/milestones)
to define the scope for each release, so that people will have visibility into
how work is progressing.
