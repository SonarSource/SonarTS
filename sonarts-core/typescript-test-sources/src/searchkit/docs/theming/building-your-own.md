# Using Your Own Styles
If you want to take control of the component's styling to suit your app, you have a number of options.

## Component's mod container
Most components support a `mod` prop which allows you to change the component's BEM block element. Useful for when you want one particular component to be styled different. See component API docs.

## Overriding markup
Most components support overriding display components via the `component`, `listComponent` or `itemComponent` props. See component API docs.
