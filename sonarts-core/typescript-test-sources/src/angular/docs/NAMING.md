Naming Conventions in Angular
---

In general Angular should follow TypeScript naming conventions.
See: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines


Classes:
  - Example: `Compiler`, `ApplicationMetadata`
  - Camel case with first letter upper-case
  - In general prefer single words. (This is so that when appending `Proto` or `Factory` the class 
    is still reasonable to work with.)
  - Should not end with `Impl` or any other word which describes a specific implementation of an 
    interface.
  
  
Interfaces:
  - Follow the same rules as Classes 
  - Should not have `I` or `Interface` in the name or any other way of identifying it as an interface.

  
Methods and functions:
  - Example: `bootstrap`, `someMethod`
  - Should be camel case with first lower case


Constants
  - Example: `CORE_DIRECTIVES`
  - Should be all uppercase with SNAKE_CASE
