# Saved Responses for Angular's Issue Tracker

The following are canned responses that the Angular team should use to close issues on our issue tracker that fall into the listed resolution categories.

Since GitHub currently doesn't allow us to have a repository-wide or organization-wide list of [saved replies](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-saved-replies/), these replies need to be maintained by individual team members. Since the responses can be modified in the future, all responses are versioned to simplify the process of keeping the responses up to date.
