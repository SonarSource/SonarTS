# Pushing changes into the Angular tree

Please see [Using git with Angular repositories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8nijFSaa1jG_UE8v4WP7glh5qOUXnYtAtJh_gwOQHI/edit)
for details about how we maintain a linear commit history, and the rules for committing.

As a contributor, just read the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and send a pull request.
Someone with committer access will do the rest.

# Change approvals

Change approvals in our monorepo are managed via [pullapprove.com](https://about.pullapprove.com/) and are configured via the `.pullapprove.yaml` file.


# Merging

Once a change has all the approvals either the last approver or the PR author (if PR author has the project collaborator status) should mark the PR with "PR: merge" label.
This signals to the caretaker that the PR should be merged.
