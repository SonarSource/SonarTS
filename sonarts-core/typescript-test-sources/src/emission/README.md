# Reactions ⇒ Emissions

Emission is a collection of [React Native] Components which are consumed by [Eigen]. A writeup on how & why we made a lot of the repo decisions is on our [blog here].

Inside here you will find:

* An example app for building and running Emission's components with an Eigen-like API.
* An NPM module that relies on React Native and manages the components.
* A Podspec that wraps it all together for easy external usage in Eigen.

### Meta

* __State:__ production
* __Point People:__ [@sarahscott](https://github.com/sarahscott), [@alloy](https://github.com/alloy)
* __CI:__ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/artsy/emission.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/artsy/emission)

This is a core [Artsy Mobile](https://github.com/artsy/mobile) OSS project, along with [Energy](https://github.com/artsy/energy), [Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon), [Eigen](https://github.com/artsy/eigen) and [Emergence](https://github.com/artsy/emergence).

### Installation

1. Install [Node.js][node], and [Yarn][yarn]: `$ brew install node yarn`
2. Install file watcher used by React Native:
   * `$ brew install pcre`
   * `$ brew link pcre`
   * `$ brew install watchman --HEAD`
3. Install NPM modules: `$ yarn install`
4. Install CocoaPods: `$ gem install cocoapods`
5. Install Pods: `$ cd Example && ARTSY_STAFF_MEMBER=true pod install`

Why Yarn? See [our JS glossary for Yarn][glossary-yarn],

### Using VS Code as an IDE

There is a comprehensive document covering [our setup here](docs/vscode.md).

### Vanilla Commands

1. Run `$ yarn start` from the top directory, which will:
   * Clean the example app’s Xcode build dir.
   * Start the example app’s React Native packager.
   * Start the React Storybooks environment.

2. Now from Xcode you can run the app in `Example/Emission.xcworkspace`.

### Debugging

There is a comprehensive document covering [the various options](docs/debugging.md).

### Updating Dependencies

1. We vendor some data from other repositories that you will sometimes need to update. You can either update all of them
   with `$ yarn run sync-externals` or individually:
   * The GraphQL schema of metaphysics that Relay uses to generate queries from: `$ yarn run sync-schema`
   * The colors defined in Artsy’s style-guide: `$ yarn run sync-colors`

### Using Relay

Some helpful Relay documentation is listed below, but the general workflow is:

1. Build a fragment for each child component that specifies only the attributes used by the component itself (no
   extraneous information).
2. Ensure the parent component calls `getFragment` for each child component that uses Relay.
3. Make sure to supply every child component’s `props` upon instantiation in the parent.

----

Another gotcha is around fragments that use variables. For this it is important to understand that whenever a Relay
backed hierarchy is used, 2 trees will be rendered.

1. A tree of all Relay query fragments is rendered into a single query.
2. Once the query has been performed, the view component tree is rendered.

What this means in practice, is that you will need to pass variables down _both_ those trees.
1. Once from the [Relay route](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/api-reference-relay-route.html) down through all
   `getFragment(name, variables)` calls.
2. Second down through the props of all components.

See:
* https://github.com/artsy/emission/commit/e84940b8360b8c5b838045a619be5b8558d5fad7
* https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/309#issuecomment-140485321

----

Try quitting and restarting your node instance if you change something Relay-related and you run into this error:

```
Unhandled JS Exception: RelayQL: Unexpected invocation at runtime. Either the Babel transform was not set up, or it
failed to identify this call site. Make sure it is being used verbatim as `Relay.QL`
```

### Deployment

1. Update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file to reflect the version that will be released.
2. Bump the version in the [npm package](package.json) file.
3. Ensure the correct dependencies are installed: `$ yarn install`
4. Create the compiled JS bundle: `$ yarn bundle`
5. Update the example installation: `$ cd Example && pod install`
6. Commit all changes and tag release.
7. Generate Emission podspec and push it to [the Artsy spec-repo](https://github.com/artsy/Specs):

   ```
   $ mkdir -p ~/.cocoapods/repos/artsy/Emission/[VERSION]
   $ pod ipc spec Emission.podspec > ~/.cocoapods/repos/artsy/Emission/[VERSION]/Emission.podspec.json
   ```

8. Also ensure that the React version required by Emission has been published to our spec-repo.
