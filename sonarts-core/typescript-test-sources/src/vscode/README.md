[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of
a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code
provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

VS Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, Mac and Linux on [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases everyday, you can install the [Insiders version of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders). This builds from the master branch and is updated at least daily.
