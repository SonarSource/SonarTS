      Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in
      (possibly nested) objects and arrays. However, it is possible to create an empty pattern that
      has no effect. When empty curly braces or brackets are used to the right of a property name
      most of the time the intent was to use a default value instead.`,
